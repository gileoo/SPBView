# SPBView

Eyetracking data analysis for saccadic exeriments. The focus is on reaction time evaluation, quick manual correction and classification of targets, blink detection, as well as pupil size evaluation.
It was developed to execute clinical and psychological experiments.

It provides a dedicated UI gathers an overview of the whole experiment run of blinks and target events. Target can be selected for details inspection. Reaction time, error to the gaze target, pro/anti-saccadic intervals, pupil size, as well as configurable labels are shown for evaluation. The reaction time can be correction manually as well as target classified. Target and blink event can then be exported as table for further statistical analysis.
