# Example Setup 1
This is a short step by step guidance to view and analyze the recording stored in:  
```
exampleData/example01-TimeLabels.tsv
```

## 1) Configure header names

SPBView openss .tsv or .csv files. To read in the required values, the names of the headers must be provided in a config file. 
Please open the first lines of the __.tsv__ file (e.g. as a spreadsheet) as well as the __InputData.conf__ in a text editor of your choice: VS code, vim, or also Notepad will do the job.
Go through all the data value header names, e.g. top down in the __.conf__ file and ensure that the text matches the related column headers.
